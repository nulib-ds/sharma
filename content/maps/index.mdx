# Map

Maps aggregate navPlace `Point` features and optional `MapPoint` callouts so geographic context sits alongside your prose. Use it for quick location overviews or to anchor itineraries. Authors can narrate journeys, trace expeditions, or compare regional clusters while markers update live, keeping spatial context woven into the storytelling.

When essays discuss routes or cite multiple repositories, sprinkling `MapPoint` entries reinforces scale and direction. The additional paragraph space lets you describe historical setting, travel logistics, or archival provenance while readers pan across the map.
