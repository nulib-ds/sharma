An exhibit label is more than a name tag—it is a bridge between the artwork and its audience. Its primary role is identification, providing essential details such as the title, artist, date, and medium. This information situates the piece within its historical and creative context.
Beyond identification, labels offer interpretation. A concise description or curatorial insight can illuminate themes, techniques, or symbolism, helping viewers engage more deeply—especially with abstract or conceptual works.  

Labels also serve an educational function, introducing visitors to art movements, cultural influences, and historical significance. They often include accessibility features such as translations, braille, or QR codes for audio guides, ensuring inclusivity.

Finally, exhibit labels support cataloging and research, often displaying accession numbers for institutional records.
In short, a well-crafted label transforms passive viewing into active understanding, guiding visitors to connect with art on intellectual and emotional levels.
