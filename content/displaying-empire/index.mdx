  title="Displaying Empire"
  description={
    <>
      The term <em>Company Painting</em> has come to stand in for works produced
      by Indian and British artists associated with the East India Company over
      the course of the consolidation of the British Empire in India from the
      eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. Works in this broad category range
      from depictions of customs and occupations, natural history subjects, and
      topographical paintings embodying the complex visual processes that shaped
      Britain’s reimagination of India as a colony and extension of its empire.
      This student-curated exhibit is based on a cache of East India
      Company-associated paintings, prints, and illustrated books in the Charles
      Deering McCormick Library's Special Collections and University Archives.

    title="Embassy of Hyderbeck to Calcutta"
    summary="This large-scale mezzotint and stipple engraving depicts a diplomatic procession traveling through the Indian landscape en route to Calcutta. At the center of the composition, elaborately dressed figures ride in howdahs atop horses, accompanied by soldiers, attendants, and local travelers carrying baskets and goods. Flags, spears, and musical instruments emphasize the ceremonial nature of the embassy, while ruins and distant architecture situate the scene within a historicized South Asian setting. Based on a painting by Johan Joseph Zoffany and engraved by Richard Earlom in London, the print translates a moment of cross-cultural encounter into a highly detailed image intended for British audiences, reflecting late eighteenth-century imperial interests in India and the East India Company’s diplomatic presence."
