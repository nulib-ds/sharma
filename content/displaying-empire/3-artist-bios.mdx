## Thomas and William Daniell

In April 1785 British artist Thomas Daniell (1749-1840) set out for India with his nephew, William Daniell (1769-1837), and the goal of advancing his career as a landscape painter. Their voyage marked the beginning of a seven-years-long tour across the Indian subcontinent from 1786-1793.

As a teenager, Thomas Daniell worked as an apprentice painting coaches under a Mr. Maxwell. By 1772, he advanced his artisanship to the Royal Academy Schools where he exhibited 30 pictures over 12 years, leaving England in 1784. However, Thomas’s momentum as a landscape painter slowed as the market for portraits in England grew increasingly saturated.

In 1779, Thomas’s nephew, William, started working as an assistant for his uncle after the premature death of his father. In England, Daniell and his nephew experimented with nascent aquatinting techniques, a new medium that promised similarities to watercolors. As Thomas Daniell confronted the narrow domestic market for landscape illustrations in the late-18th century, word of enterprising opportunities for artists in British colonies in South Asia reached England. Already, several European painters had found patrons abroad after relocating with the assistance of the East India Company. At the same time, English attitudes toward landscapes and architecture enabled the embracing of concepts like the picturesque and the sublime. Sensing a window of opportunity to develop his career while catering to a British desire to view the Empire abroad, Daniell applied to the East India Company to work as an engraver in Calcutta.

The Daniells departed for Calcutta on April 7, 1785. The next time they set foot on English soil would be nearly 10 years later. The Daniells embarked upon three distinct tours of the subcontinent, benefitting from the aid of various native artists and assistants. With their help, the Daniells assembled material for a six-volume work titled *Oriental Scenery*, published from 1795 through 1808.[^1]
